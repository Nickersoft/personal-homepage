During my time at Coursera, I lead the front-end development of several high-lift product initiatives, including the new learning assistant and goal setting system. 

I also helped to drive the development of engineering efforts, primarily focusing on our team's codebase-wide migration from the [BackboneJS](https://backbonejs.org) UI framework to React.
