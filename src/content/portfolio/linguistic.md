By far my proudest work to date, [Linguistic's](/projects/linguistic) design language was built from the ground-up, the product of constant evolution and iteration since the project's inception in 2015. As both the lead developer and designer on the project, I was presented with the unique opportunity of being able to build the product end-to-end, from the initial drafting of the UI to its rollout on the iOS App Store. Keep in mind, due to its development outside the confines of a traditional design team, the approach taken here in terms of design exploration are relatively unconventional. If I were to do it all again, the approach would be more formalized.

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** In today's edtech landscape, it is still relatively difficult to practice communicating in a language while studying it on apps such as Duolingo or Memrise. While language exchanges exist, they are unstructured and provide little means to further the learner's knowledge.

**Solution:** Develop a language exchange with the structured format of a language learning platform such as Duolingo, and provide tools and resources to actively helpers learn while using it.
