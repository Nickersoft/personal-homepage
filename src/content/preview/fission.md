Fission was an online, decentralized cloud storage solution for files. How it worked was simple. Users upload files, those files were split into chunks, then distributed across the network.

Developed at UC Berkeley in 2014, Fission was built on a mixture of PHP, Objective-C, JavaScript, among other web technologies.
