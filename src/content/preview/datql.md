DatQL (or DQL) is a GraphQL-inspired markup language that transpiles to vanilla SQL. By abstracting platform-specific SQL queries to a common syntax, the underlying DB can be replaced at any time.

DatQL was originally developed to satisfy the needs of Linguistic and now exists as free OSS under the Linguistic organization.
