### Abstract

We introduce Linguistic, a novel language learning platform that leverages crowdsourcing and conversation to offer a truly unique approach to language education. As opposed to similar platforms, individuals learn vocabularyterms through conversing with conversation partners who speak their target language natively. These individuals are then given the ability to practice saved vocabulary terms within the app. The system then applies machine learning and natural language processing techniques to infer learner proficiency from these conversations, eventually suggesting foreign media to assist the individual in expanding their proficiency and understanding of the language. Additionally, the platform applies this inferred proficiency information in order to improve future user matching. In this paper, we discuss the implications of such a platform, the motivation for bringing the platform to market, as well as the future of the platform. Furthermore, we discuss the methodology of several key features integrated into the Linguistic platform, including the platformâ€™s unique matching system, recommendation system, and message processing techniques.
